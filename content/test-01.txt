Today Tom and his sister go to the park.
They see many kids. Some kids play ball, and some kids jump and laugh.
Tom likes to walk and see the flowers. His sister likes to push and pull the swing.

Suddenly, Tom says, “Look! Who is that?”
A little dog runs fast. It can jump and run everywhere.
“Whose dog is this?” Tom asks.
A boy comes and says, “It is my dog. His name is Lucky.”

Tom feels happy. He likes the dog.
“Can I play with Lucky?” he asks.
“Yes,” says the boy, “but be careful.”
Tom pulls a stick, and Lucky runs to find it.
They play until the sun goes down.
It is a good day for all of them.
