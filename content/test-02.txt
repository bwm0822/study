This is a sunny day.
Many kids go to the playground. Some kids jump and laugh.
Two teachers help the kids play. Both teachers are kind.

Tom and Amy like to walk around. They see a big slide.
“Which one is taller, this slide or that swing?” Tom asks.
Amy says, “The slide is taller.”
They pull the rope and push the swing.

Suddenly, a girl cries. “Oh no! Where is my ball?”
“Whose ball is this?” asks a teacher.
The girl says, “It is mine!” She is happy again.

Every kid can play. All kids feel safe.
The teachers say, “Why do you laugh?”
The kids answer, “Because we are happy!”

At the end, they count the balls.
“Look! The number of balls is ten,” says Amy.
It is a good day for everyone.
